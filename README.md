Testing out this function

Hi I'm Kris and I'm doing the Freetail Hackers challenge! I think Yuriy is a terrible person but at least he's good at Pokemon and Hackathons.

Finished Day 2 by writing like 5 lines of code. I'm trying yo.

I don't know what day it is (like 4) but I may have missed a day because I keep committing at like 11pm oops.
